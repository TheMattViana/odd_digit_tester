Project: Create a "PIN Upgrade Security Study" Web Interface

Context: I need a functional web interface to test user behavior when upgrading PINs, based on the research paper "The Same PIN, Just Longer." In the original paper, users upgraded from 4 to 6 digits. In this version, we are testing a 5-digit to 7-digit upgrade using a constrained keypad.

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS (Tailwind preferred), JavaScript (or React).

1. UI/Visual Design:

Aesthetic: Mimic the clean, minimal design of the iOS Lock Screen (blur background, white circular buttons with thin outlines).

The Keypad: This is a crucial constraint. The keypad must only display odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). Arrange them in a balanced grid (e.g., two rows of 3, or a custom circle layout). Do not include even numbers.

Feedback: Display empty hollow circles at the top representing the digits. When a user taps a number, the circle should fill white (standard iOS behavior).

2. Functional Logic & Flow (The "Sequence"): The app should guide the user through a two-step "Upgrade" sequence, similar to the methodology in the Munyendo et al. paper:

Step 1 (The Baseline):

Title: "Create a 5-digit PIN".

Constraint: User must enter exactly 5 digits using the odd-number keypad.

Action: Upon the 5th digit, store the PIN and automatically transition to an interstitial screen.

Step 2 (The Upgrade Justification):

Show a message based on the "Device Upgrade" treatment from the paper.

Text: "Imagine you are upgrading your smartphone to a system that requires higher security. You must now select a 7-digit PIN."

Button: "Continue."

Step 3 (The Upgrade):

Title: "Create a 7-digit PIN".

Constraint: User must enter exactly 7 digits.

Action: Upon the 7th digit, submit and display the "Results" modal.

3. Analysis & Results (The "Targeted Attack" Logic): Once the user finishes, display a "Security Analysis" card that checks for the vulnerabilities described in the paper:

Targeted Append Check: Did the user simply take their 5-digit PIN and add 2 digits to the end? (This was a major vulnerability found in the paper ).

Repetition Check: Did they use repeated patterns (e.g., 1111111)?

Subsequence Check: Does the 7-digit PIN contain the 5-digit PIN entirely?

4. Code Requirements:

Make the design responsive (mobile-first).

Use local state to store the PINs (no backend needed for this prototype).

Ensure the keypad has active states (button press animations).

---

The regular 0 - 9 possible digits should still be a thing, the only odd-ness are the number of digits used

---

this has to be very phone friendly for best experience

---

add the letters under the buttons like abc under 1, and make the numbers white so its easier to see

---

write all prompts I used in a prompts.txt file

---

add and push this to a github webpage. https://github.com/TheMattViana/odd_digit_tester.git

remember to make it look good on a phone

---

always always always keep prompts.txt updated

---

change the end to be a thank you for completing, and make it save the passwords in a way our research team can easily see them. maybe a csv / log, or email my work email with response mmv5513@psu.edu

---

the results should automatically be saved in a way I can see them as the researcher

additionally:
update the prompts txt. and see instructions .txt for a final detailed update 

Instructions.txt content:

Baseline Selection (The "Before" Snapshot)

What it is: Participants are asked to create a 5-digit PIN that they would actually use on a smartphone.

Why: This establishes a control point. Since 5-digit PINs are rare, the researchers need to understand how people naturally create them (e.g., do they use dates? patterns?) before any "upgrade" pressure is applied.

Distractor/Recall (The Memory Test)

What it is: Immediately after choosing a PIN, participants answer unrelated questions (distractors) about their phone usage to clear their short-term memory. They are then asked to type their 5-digit PIN again.

Why: Real-world PINs must be memorable. If a participant creates a complex PIN but forgets it 30 seconds later, it isn't a valid data point for a study on authentication. This phase filters out random or unmemorable entries.

Upgrade Selection (The Main Experiment)

What it is: Participants are forced to change their authenticated 5-digit PIN to a new 7-digit PIN based on a specific scenario (the "treatment").

Why: This simulates the real-world frustration of mandatory security updates. The researchers want to see if users get lazy when forced to upgrade (e.g., by just adding "12" to the end of their old PIN) or if specific warnings (like "your PIN was breached") encourage them to choose safer numbers..

I have added our full methds to instrictions.txt make sure the app matches that

When I open the app on my phone the 0 digit is cut off in the page and I cant even scroll down to fix it

I DONT HAVE A SERVER, WE HAE TO SEND THIS TO MY EMAIL AUTOMNATICALLY
